# Modeling Affect Intensity: SemEval 2018 Task 1

Existing emotion and sentiment datasets are mainly annotated categorically without an indication of degree of emotion. Further, the tasks are almost always framed as classification tasks (identify 1 among n affect categories for this sentence). In contrast, it is often useful for applications to know the degree to which an affect category is expressed in text. In this task systems have to automatically determine the intensity of affect in tweets.
